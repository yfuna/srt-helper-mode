1
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,600
"Two households, both alike in dignity,

2
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,800
in fair Verona, where we lay our scene,

3
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,200
from ancient grudge
break to new mutiny,

4
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,400
where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

5
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,000
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes

6
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,000
a pair of star-cross'd lovers
take their life."

7
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,200
The Capulets, the Capulets.

8
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,000
The Capulets.

9
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,800
The Montagues.

10
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,600
The Montagues.

11
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,400
Here come the Capulets.

12
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,200
Be patient. Take no note.

13
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,800
- The House of Montague, our foe.
- Soft.

14
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,200
Keep the peace.

15
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,200
I strike quickly, being moved,

16
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,400
when a dog of the House of Montague
moves me.

17
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,200
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

18
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,200
- I do bite my thumb, sir.
- Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

19
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,800
- Is the law on our side if I say ay?
- No.

20
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,600
No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir,

21
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,600
but I do bite my thumb, sir.

22
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,000
- Do you quarrel, sir?
- Quarrel, sir?

23
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,000
- No, sir.
- If you do, sir, I am for you.

24
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,400
I serve as good a man as you.

25
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,400
No better.

26
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
- Say "better."
- Yes, better.

27
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,400
- You lie.
- Draw, if you be men.

28
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,200
Part, fools!

29
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,600
Put up your swords.

30
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,400
Put up your swords.

31
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,800
What? Art thou drawn amongst
these heartless hinds?

32
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,400
Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.

33
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,800
I do but keep the peace.

34
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,800
Put up thy sword
or manage it to part these men with me.

35
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,600
What? Drawn, and talk of peace?

36
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,600
I hate the word as I hate hell,
all Montagues and thee.

37
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,200
Have at thee, coward.

38
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,400
Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace.

39
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,800
Will they not hear?

40
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,200
What ho, you men, you beasts,
on pain of torture.

41
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,200
Throw your mis-temper'd weapons
to the ground

42
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,000
and hear the sentence
of your moved Prince.

43
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,800
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word
by thee, old Capulet,

44
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,600
and Montague, have thrice disturb'd
the quiet of our streets.

45
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,200
If ever you disturb our streets again,

46
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,800
your lives
shall pay the forfeit of the peace.

47
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,600
For this time, all the rest depart away.

48
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,200
You, Capulet, shall go along with me,

49
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,600
and, Montague,

50
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,200
come you this afternoon
to know our further pleasure in this case.

51
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,200
Once more, on pain of death,

52
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,200
all men depart.

53
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,800
But Montague is bound as well as I,

54
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,600
in penalty alike.

55
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,800
And 'tis not hard, I think,
for men as old as we to keep the peace.

56
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,400
Of honorable reckoning are you both.
And pity it is you've lived at odds so long.

57
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,400
But now, my lord,
what say you to my suit?

58
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,200
But saying o'er what I have said before.

59
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,800
My child is yet a stranger in the world.

60
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart.

61
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,400
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,

62
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,600
whereto I have invited
many a guest such as I love,

63
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,800
and you, among the store, one more,
most welcome, makes my number more.

64
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,800
Sirrah.

65
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,600
Sirrah!

66
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,400
Go, trudge about through fair Verona,

67
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,400
find those persons out
whose names are written there,

68
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,000
and to them say my house
and welcome on their pleasure stay.

69
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,200
Nurse.

70
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,400
Nurse.

71
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Where's my daughter?
Call her forth to me.

72
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,200
I bade her come. What, lamb.

73
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,000
What, ladybird.

74
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,000
God forbid. Where's this girl?

75
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,200
What, Juliet!

76
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,200
Madam, what is your will?

77
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,400
This is the matter.

78
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,600
Nurse, give leave awhile.
We must talk in secret.

79
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,400
Nurse, come back again.

80
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,000
I have remember'd me,
thou'st hear our counsel.

81
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,400
Thou know'st my daughter's
of a pretty age.

82
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,400
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.

83
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,600
Susan and she, God rest
all Christian souls, were of an age.

84
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,400
Well, Susan is with God.
She was too good for me.

85
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,800
But as I said,

86
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,800
my lord and you were then at Mantua.

87
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,600
For then she could stand alone.

88
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,200
Nay, by the rood,
she could have run and waddled all about.

89
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,600
For even the day before,
she broke her brow.

90
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,800
And then my husband,
God be with his soul, he was a merry man,

91
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,200
took up the child. "Yea," quoth he,
"Dost thou fall upon thy face?

92
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,200
"Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast
more wit. Wilt thou not, Jule?"

93
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,600
And, by my halidom, the pretty wretch
left crying, and said, "Ay."

94
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,400
To see now how a jest may come about.

95
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,800
I warrant, and I should live
a thousand years, I never should forget it.

96
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,200
"Wilt thou not, Jule?" quoth he.

97
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,200
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said, "Ay."

98
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,400
Enough of this. I pray thee, hold thy peace.

99
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,400
Peace, I have done.
God mark thee to his grace.

100
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Thou wast the prettiest babe
that e'er I nursed.

101
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,400
And I might live to see thee married once,
I have my wish.

102
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,800
Marry, that "marry" is the very theme
I came to talk of.

103
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,800
Tell me, daughter Juliet,

104
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,800
how stands your disposition
to be married?

105
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,400
It is an honor that I dream not of.

106
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,800
Well, think of marriage now.

107
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,800
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

108
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,800
My will to her consent is but a part.

109
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,800
Oh, a man, young lady.

110
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,600
Lady, such a man as all the world.

111
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,200
Why, he's a man of wax.

112
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,200
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.

113
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,000
Nay, he's a flower. In faith, a very flower.

114
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,000
What say you?
Can you love the gentleman?

115
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,400
This night you shall
behold him at our feast.

116
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,600
Speak briefly. Can you like of Paris' love?

117
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'll look to like, if looking liking move.

118
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,000
But no more deep will I endart mine eye

119
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,000
than your consent
gives strength to make it fly.

120
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,400
Good morrow, cousin.

121
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,200
Is the day so young?

122
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,800
But new struck 9:00.

123
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,200
And here I hit it right,
our Romeo has not been in bed tonight.

124
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,000
Ay me, sad hours seem long.

125
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,800
What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

126
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,400
Not having that which having
makes them short.

127
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,800
- In love?
- Out.

128
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,200
- Of love?
- Out of her favor where I am in love.

129
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:50,400
Jesu Maria ! What a deal of brine hath
washed thy sallow cheek for Rosaline.

130
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,400
Rosaline.

131
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,000
Dost thou not laugh?

132
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,400
No, coz, I rather weep.

133
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,800
- Good heart, at what?
- At thy good heart's oppression.

134
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,000
Why, such is love's transgression.

135
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,800
Love is a smoke
raised with the fume of sighs,

136
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,600
being purged,
a fire sparkling in lover's eyes,

137
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,200
being vexed,
a sea nourished with lover's tears.

138
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,000
What is it else?

139
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,200
A madness most discreet,
a choking gall and a preserving sweet.

140
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,200
And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,

141
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,200
from love's weak childish bow
she lives unharmed.

142
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,200
Be ruled by me. Forget to think of her.

143
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,400
Oh, teach me how I should forget to think.

144
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,000
By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
Examine other beauties.

145
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,400
He that is strucken blind

146
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,400
cannot forget the precious treasure
of his eyesight lost.

147
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,000
Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
what doth her beauty serve but as a note

148
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,600
where I may read
who pass'd that passing fair?

149
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,400
Tut, man, one fire burns out
another's burning.

150
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,600
One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish.

151
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
and the rank poison of the old will die.

152
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,000
Romeo, art thou mad?

153
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,800
No, not mad,
but bound more than a madman is.

154
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,600
Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
whipp'd and tormented.

155
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,600
Good den, good fellow.

156
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,800
God gi' good den. I pray, sir, can you read?

157
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,000
Ay, my own fortune in my misery.

158
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,800
Well, perhaps you have learn'd it
without book,

159
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
but I pray, sir,
can you read anything you see?

160
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,000
Ay, if I know the letters and the language.

161
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,600
- Ye say honestly. Rest you merry.
- Stay, fellow, I can read.

162
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,800
"Signor Martino and his wife
and daughters,

163
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,600
"County Anselme
and his beauteous sisters,

164
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,000
"the lady widow of Vitruvio,

165
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,000
"Signor Placentio and his lovely nieces,

166
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,400
"Mercutio and his brother Valentine.

167
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,800
"Signor Valentio and his cousin Tybalt."

168
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Tybalt.

169
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,200
"My fair niece Rosaline."

170
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
A fair assembly.
Whither should they come?

171
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,200
- Up.
- Whither?

172
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,000
- To supper, to our house.
- To whose house?

173
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,400
- My master's.
- Yes, indeed,

174
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,200
I should have asked you that before.

175
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,400
Now I'll tell you without asking.
My master is the great rich Capulet.

176
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,400
And if you be not
of the House of Montague,

177
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,200
I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
Rest you merry.

178
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,200
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
sups the fair Rosaline

179
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,400
whom thou so lov'st
with all the admired beauties of Verona.

180
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
Go thither, and with unattainted eye

181
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,600
compare her face
with some that I shall show.

182
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,200
- I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
- One fairer than my love?

183
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,200
The all-seeing sun ne'er saw her match
since first the world begun.

184
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,600
I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,

185
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
but to rejoice in splendor of mine own.

186
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,000
- Mercutio.
- Come, supper is served.

187
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,600
I shall not budge.

188
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,000
- Come, let's away.
- I shall not budge for no man's pleasure.

189
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,000
Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.

190
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,600
Nay, gentle Romeo,
we must have you dance.

191
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,000
Not I, believe me.

192
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,600
You have dancing shoes with nimble soles.

193
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,800
I have a soul of lead so stakes me
to the ground I cannot move.

194
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,000
You are a lover, borrow Cupid's wings

195
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,400
and soar with them
above a common bound.

196
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,400
Come, let us enter, and no sooner in,
but every man betake him to his legs.

197
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,000
And we mean well
in going to this masque.

198
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,800
- But 'tis no wit to go.
- Why, may one ask?

199
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,600
I dream'd a dream last night.

200
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,800
- And so did I.
- What was yours?

201
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,600
That dreamers often lie.

202
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,400
In bed asleep,
while they do dream things true.

203
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,600
O, then,
I see Queen Mab hath been with you.

204
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,400
She is the fairies' midwife,

205
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,400
and she comes in shape
no bigger than an agate stone

206
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,000
upon the forefinger of an alderman.

207
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,400
Drawn with a team of little atomies

208
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,000
athwart men's noses as they lie asleep.

209
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,000
Her wagon spokes
made of long spinner's legs.

210
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,600
The covers, of the wings of grasshoppers.

211
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,800
The traces, of the smallest spider's web.

212
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,200
The collars,
of the moonshine's watery beams.

213
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,000
Her whip, of cricket's bone.
The lash, of film.

214
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,800
Her waggoner, a small gray-coated gnat,

215
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,400
not half so big as a round little worm

216
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,400
prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid.

217
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,600
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,

218
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,200
made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,

219
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,800
time out of mind the fairies' coach-makers.

220
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,600
And in this state
she gallops night by night

221
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,600
through lovers' brains,
and then they dream on love.

222
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,400
O'er courtiers' knees,
who dream on curtsies straight.

223
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,200
O'er lawyers' fingers
who straight dream on fees.

224
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,000
O'er ladies lips,
who straight on kisses dream.

225
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,000
Sometimes she gallops
o'er a courtier's nose,

226
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
and then dreams he of smelling out a suit.

227
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And sometimes come she
with a tithe-pig's tail

228
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,400
tickling a parson's nose as he lies asleep,
then dreams he of another benefice.

229
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,400
Sometimes she driveth
o'er a soldier's neck,

230
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,800
and then dreams he of cutting foreign
throats, of breaches, ambuscadoes,

231
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,600
Spanish blades,
of healths five fathom deep.

232
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,600
And then anon drums in his ears,
at which he starts and wakes,

233
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
and being thus frighted swears a prayer
or two and sleeps again.

234
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,400
- This is that very Mab. This is she...
- Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace.

235
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,200
Thou talk'st of nothing.

236
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,400
True, I talk of dreams,

237
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,200
which are the children of an idle brain,
begot of nothing but vain fantasy,

238
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,800
as thin of substance as the air,

239
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,600
and more inconstant than the wind.

240
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,400
This wind you talk of
blows us from ourselves.

241
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,000
Supper is done
and we shall come too late.

242
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,600
I fear, too early.

243
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,600
For my mind misgives some consequence
yet hanging in the stars

244
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,200
shall bitterly begin his fearful date
with this night's revels.

245
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,400
But he, that hath the steerage
of my course, direct my sail.

246
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,000
On, lusty gentlemen.

247
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,400
Strike drum.

248
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,200
Welcome, gentlemen.

249
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,000
I have seen the day
that I have worn a visor,

250
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,600
and could tell a whispering tale
in a fair lady's ear,

251
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,400
such as would please.

252
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,000
'Tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone.

253
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,800
You are welcome, gentlemen.

254
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,200
The fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st.

255
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,400
She hath forsworn to love.

256
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,400
Thou canst not teach me to forget.

257
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,400
What lady's that which doth enrich
the hand of yonder knight?

258
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,200
I know not, sir.

259
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,400
Oh, she doth teach
the torches to burn bright.

260
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:08,000
It seems she hangs upon the cheek
of night like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear.

261
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,200
Did my heart love till now?
Forswear it, sight.

262
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,200
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.

263
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,200
This, by his voice, should be a Montague.

264
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,200
Fetch me my rapier, boy.

265
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,400
What? Dares the slave come hither
cover'd with an antic face

266
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,400
to fleer and scorn at our solemnity?

267
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,400
Why, how now, kinsman?
Wherefore storm you so?

268
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,400
Uncle, this is a Montague.

269
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,400
Our foe,
a villain that is hither come in spite

270
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,600
to scorn at our solemnity this night.

271
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,600
- Young Romeo, is it?
- 'Tis he, that villain Romeo.

272
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,800
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.

273
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,800
I wouldn't for the wealth of all this town
here in my house do him disparagement.

274
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,600
Therefore be patient, take no note of him.

275
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,200
- I'll not endure him.
- He shall be endur'd.

276
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,200
What, goodman boy. I say, he shall.

277
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,800
Go to. Am I the master here or you?

278
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Go to. You'll not endure him.

279
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,200
- Why, Uncle, 'tis a shame.
- Go to. Go to.

280
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,000
You are a saucy boy.

281
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,600
I will withdraw.

282
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:24,200
But this intrusion shall, now
seeming sweet, convert to bitterest gall.

283
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,800
If I profane with my unworthiest hand
this holy shrine,

284
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,400
the gentle fine is this.

285
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,200
My lips, two blushing pilgrims,

286
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,000
ready stand to smooth that rough touch
with a tender kiss.

287
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,400
Good pilgrim,
you do wrong your hand too much.

288
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,200
For saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch,

289
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,800
and palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

290
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,000
Have not saints lips,
and holy palmers, too?

291
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,600
Ay, pilgrim,
lips that they must use in prayer.

292
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,200
O, then, dear saint,

293
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,200
let lips do what hands do.

294
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,600
They pray, grant thou,
lest faith turn to despair.

295
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,600
Saints do not move,
though grant for prayers' sake.

296
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,000
Then move not,
while my prayers' effect I take.

297
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,400
Thus from my lips by thine,
my sin is purged.

298
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,600
Then have my lips the sin
that they have took.

299
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,800
Sin from my lips?
Oh, trespass sweetly urged.

300
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,000
Give me my sin again.

301
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,600
Madam.

302
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,400
Madam.

303
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,800
Your mother craves a word with you.

304
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,400
What is her mother?

305
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,200
Marry, bachelor,
her mother is the lady of the house,

306
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,600
and a good lady, and a wise, and virtuous.

307
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,400
I nursed her daughter
that you talked withal.

308
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,200
Is she a Capulet?

309
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,000
O dear account.

310
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,800
My life is my foe's debt.

311
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,600
Away, be gone. The sport is at the best.

312
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,800
Ay, so I fear. The more is my unrest.

313
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,600
Come hither, nurse.

314
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,200
What is yond gentleman?

315
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,800
The son and heir of old Tiberio.

316
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,600
What's he that now is going out of door?

317
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,800
Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.

318
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,600
What's he that follows there?

319
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,000
- I know not.
- Go, ask his name.

320
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,800
His name is Romeo, and a Montague.

321
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,800
- The only son of your great enemy.
- A Montague?

322
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,800
My only love sprung from my only hate.

323
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,000
Too early seen unknown,

324
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,800
- and known too late.
- What's this, what's this?

325
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,200
A rhyme I learned e'en now
of one I danced withal.

326
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,400
Come, let's away.
The strangers all are gone.

327
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,600
Romeo.

328
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,200
Romeo. My cousin, Romeo.

329
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,800
He is wise, and, on my life,
hath stolen him home to bed.

330
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,600
He ran this way. Call, good Mercutio.

331
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,600
Nay, I'll conjure, too.

332
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:46,000
Romeo. Humors. Madman. Passion. Lover.

333
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,600
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh.

334
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,400
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied.

335
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,600
Cry but, "Ah, me."
Pronounce but "Iove" and "dove."

336
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,200
He heareth not. He stirreth not.

337
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,000
He moveth not.

338
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,600
The ape is dead,

339
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,800
and I must conjure him.

340
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,600
I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,

341
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,600
by her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
by her fine foot,

342
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,600
straight leg and quivering thigh,

343
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,200
and the demesnes that there adjacent lie,

344
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,800
that in thy likeness thou appear to us.

345
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Come, he hath hid himself
among these trees.

346
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Blind is his love and best befits the dark.

347
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,000
Romeo, good night. I'll to my truckle-bed.

348
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,800
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.

349
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,800
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.

350
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,800
But, soft. What light
through yonder window breaks?

351
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,200
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.

352
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,800
It is my lady. Oh, it is my love.

353
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,000
Oh, that she knew she were.

354
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,800
See how she leans her cheek
upon her hand.

355
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,200
Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand
that I might touch that cheek.

356
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,000
Ay me!

357
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Oh, speak again, bright angel.

358
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,000
For thou art as glorious to this night,
being o'er my head,

359
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,600
as is a winged messenger of heaven.

360
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,200
O Romeo. Romeo.

361
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,200
Wherefore art thou Romeo?

362
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Deny thy father and refuse thy name.

363
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:16,200
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,

364
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
and I'll no longer be a Capulet.

365
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,600
Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?

366
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,600
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.

367
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,400
What's in a name?

368
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,400
That which we call a rose
by any other name would smell as sweet.

369
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,000
So Romeo would,
were he were not Romeo called,

370
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:41,400
retain that dear perfection
which he owes without that title.

371
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,800
Romeo, doff thy name,

372
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,400
and for that name which is no part of thee,

373
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,600
take all myself.

374
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,000
I take thee at thy word.

375
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,000
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized.

376
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,800
What man art thou,
that thus be screened in night,

377
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,400
so stumblest on my counsel?

378
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,200
By a name
I know not how to tell thee who I am.

379
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,600
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,

380
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,400
because it is an enemy to thee.

381
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,000
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred
words of that tongue's utterance,

382
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,000
yet I know the sound.

383
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?

384
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,800
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.

385
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,600
How camest thou hither, tell me,
and wherefore?

386
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,200
The orchard walls are high
and hard to climb

387
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,400
and the place death, considering who thou
art, if any of my kinsmen find thee here.

388
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,200
With love's light wings
did I o'er-perch these walls.

389
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,600
For stony limits cannot hold love out,

390
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,200
and what love can do,
that dares love attempt.

391
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,400
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.

392
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,800
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.

393
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,800
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
than twenty of their swords.

394
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Look thou but sweet,
and I am proof against their enmity.

395
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,600
I would not for the world
they saw thee here.

396
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,200
I have night's cloak to hide me
from their eyes,

397
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,800
and but thou love me,
let them find me here.

398
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,000
By whose direction
found'st thou out this place?

399
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,800
By Love's,
that first did prompt me to inquire.

400
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,400
He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.

401
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,000
I am no pilot.

402
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,800
Yet, wert thou as far as that vast shore

403
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,200
washed by the farthest sea,

404
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,800
I should adventure for such merchandise.

405
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,800
Thou know'st the mask of night
is on my face.

406
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,600
Else would a maiden blush
bepaint my cheek

407
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,400
for that which thou hast heard me
speak tonight.

408
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,400
Fain would I dwell on form,
fain, fain deny what I have spoke:

409
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,600
but farewell compliment.

410
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,600
Dost thou love me?
I know thou wilt say ay,

411
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,600
and I will take thy word.

412
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,600
Yet, if thou swear'st,
thou mayst prove false.

413
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,600
At lovers' perjuries they say Jove laughs.

414
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,400
O gentle Romeo.

415
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,600
If thou dost love,

416
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,600
pronounce it faithfully.

417
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,200
Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,

418
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,000
I'll frown and be perverse,

419
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:10,200
and say thee nay, so thou wilt woo.
Else not for the world.

420
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,400
In truth, fair Montague,

421
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,800
I am too fond.

422
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,800
Therefore pardon me,

423
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,600
and not impute this yielding to light love,

424
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,400
which the dark night hath so discovered.

425
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,000
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear

426
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
that tips with silver
all these fruit tree tops.

427
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Oh, swear not by the moon,
the inconstant moon,

428
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,600
that monthly changes in her circled orb,

429
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,600
lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

430
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,400
- What shall I swear by?
- Do not swear at all.

431
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,400
Or, if thou wilt,

432
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,600
swear by thy gracious self,

433
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,800
which is the god of my idolatry,

434
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,200
and I'll believe thee.

435
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,800
If my heart's dear love...

436
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,000
Well, do not swear.

437
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,200
Although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract tonight.

438
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,000
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden.

439
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,400
Too like the lightning, which doth cease
to be ere one can say it lightens.

440
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,000
- Sweet, good night.
- Wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

441
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,200
What satisfaction
cans't thou have tonight?

442
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,200
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow
for mine.

443
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,800
I gave thee mine
before thou dids't request it.

444
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,600
And yet I would it were to give again.

445
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,800
Wouldst thou withdraw it?
For what purpose, love?

446
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,400
But to be frank, and give it thee again.

447
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,200
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,

448
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,800
my love as deep.

449
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,600
The more I give to thee, the more I have,

450
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,200
for both are infinite.

451
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,400
I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu.

452
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,600
Juliet.

453
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:01,200
Anon, good nurse.
Sweet Montague, be true.

454
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,400
Stay but a little, I will come again.

455
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,400
O blessed, blessed night.

456
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I am afeard, being in night,
all this is but a dream,

457
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,000
too flattering-sweet to be substantial.

458
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,400
Three words, dear Romeo,
and good night, indeed.

459
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,400
If that thy bent of love be honorable,

460
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,800
thy purpose marriage,

461
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,400
send me word tomorrow by one
that I'll procure to come to thee,

462
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,200
where and what time
thou wilt perform the rite.

463
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,800
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay

464
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,800
and follow thee, my lord,
throughout the world.

465
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,200
- Madam.
- I come anon.

466
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,800
But if thou mean'st not well,
I do beseech thee...

467
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,800
- Madam.
- By and by, I come.

468
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,800
To cease thy suit
and leave me to my grief.

469
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,000
Tomorrow will I send.

470
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,800
So thrive my soul.

471
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,000
A thousand times good night.

472
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,000
A thousand times the worse,
to want thy light.

473
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,400
Romeo. Romeo.

474
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,800
- It is my soul that calls upon my name.
- Romeo.

475
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,000
How silver-sweet
sound lovers' tongues by night,

476
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,800
like softest music to attending ears.

477
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,400
My dear.

478
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,200
I have forgot why I did call thee back.

479
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Let me stand here till thou remember it.

480
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,000
I shall forget,
to have thee still stand there,

481
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,200
remembering how I love thy company.

482
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,000
And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,

483
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,200
forgetting any other home but this.

484
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
'Tis almost morning.

485
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,400
I would have thee gone,

486
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,200
and yet no further than a wanton's bird,

487
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:35,400
who lets it hop a little from her hand
and with a silk thread plucks it back again,

488
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,000
- so loving jealous of his liberty.
- I would I were thy bird.

489
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,000
Sweet, so would I.

490
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,400
Yet, I should kill thee
with much cherishing.

491
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,800
Good night. Good night.

492
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,200
Parting is such sweet sorrow

493
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,800
that I shall say good night

494
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,600
till it be morrow.

495
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:14,000
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes,
peace in thy breast.

496
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,400
Would I were sleep and peace,
so sweet to rest.

497
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,000
Where the devil should this Romeo be?

498
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,400
Came he not home last night?

499
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,200
Not to his father's. I spoke with his men.

500
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:21,200
Why, that same pale,
hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,

501
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,200
torments him so he will sure run mad.

502
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,200
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
has sent a letter to his father's house.

503
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,200
- A challenge, on my life.
- Romeo will answer it.

504
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,600
Alas, poor Romeo. He is already dead.

505
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,600
Stabbed with a white wench's black eye,

506
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,000
shot through the ear with a love song.

507
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,600
The very pin of his heart,

508
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:45,400
cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft.

509
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,400
- And is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
- Why, what is Tybalt?

510
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,800
More than prince of cats, I can tell you.

511
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Oh, he is the courageous captain
of compliments.

512
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,600
These fashion mongers,
these pardonnez-mois.

513
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,800
Their bons, their bons.

514
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
He fights as you sing prick-songs.

515
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,600
Keeps time, distance and proportion,

516
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,200
one, two and the third in your bosom.

517
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,200
The very butcher of a silk button.

518
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,800
A duelist, a duelist, the immortal passado.

519
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,400
The punto reverso. The hay.

520
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,800
Here comes Romeo.

521
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,400
Without his roe, like a dried herring.

522
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:33,000
O flesh, flesh, how thou art fishified.

523
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,800
Signor Romeo, bonjour.

524
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,200
You gave us
the counterfeit fairly last night.

525
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,800
Good morrow to you both.
What counterfeit did I give you?

526
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,400
- The slip, sir, the slip.
- Pardon, good Mercutio.

527
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:48,800
My business was great, and in such a case
as mine a man may strain courtesy.

528
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,000
That's as much as to say,
such a case as yours,

529
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,800
constrains a man to bow in the hams.

530
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
- Meaning, to curtsey.
- Thou hast most kindly hit it.

531
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
A most courteous exposition.

532
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,000
Why, is this not better now
than groaning for love?

533
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Now art thou sociable,
now art thou Romeo.

534
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,400
A sail, a sail.

535
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,600
Two, two, a shirt and a smock.

536
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,400
Peter.

537
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,600
- Anon.
- My fan, Peter.

538
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,800
Good Peter, to hide her face.

539
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,000
God ye good morrow, gentlemen.

540
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,200
- God ye good day, fair gentlewoman.
- Is it good day?

541
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:36,000
'Tis no less, I tell you,
for the bawdy hand of the dial

542
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,800
is even now upon the prick of noon.

543
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Out upon you. What a man are you!

544
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:47,600
Gentlemen, can any of you tell me
where I may find the young Romeo?

545
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:49,800
I can tell you.

546
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I'm the youngest of that name,
for want of a worse.

547
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,800
If you be he, sir,
I desire some confidence with you.

548
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,200
The young lady...

549
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,600
The young lady bade me... Get back!

550
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,800
She will invite him to some supper.

551
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,600
A bawd, a bawd, a bawd.

552
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,800
Farewell, ancient lady! Farewell.

553
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,000
Lady, lady, lady!

554
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,800
Marry, farewell. I pray you, sir,
what saucy merchant was this?

555
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,200
A gentleman, nurse,
who loves to hear himself talk.

556
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,200
And to speak anything against me,
I'll take him down

557
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,000
and a' were lustier than he is,
and twenty such Jacks.

558
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,400
And I cannot, I'll find those that shall.

559
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,400
Scurvy knave.

560
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,600
I am none of his flirt-gills.

561
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:56,000
And thou must stand by, too, and suffer
every knave to use me at his pleasure.

562
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,200
I saw no man use you at his pleasure.

563
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,600
If I had, my weapon should quickly
have been out, I warrant.

564
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:05,400
I dare draw as soon as another man
if I see occasion in a good quarrel

565
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,200
and the law on my side.

566
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:12,600
Now, afore God, I am so vexed
that every part about me quivers.

567
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,000
Scurvy knave!

568
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,600
Pray you, sir, a word.

569
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,000
As I told you,
my young lady bade me inquire you out.

570
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,200
- Yes.
- What she bade me say,

571
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,000
- I'll keep to myself.
- Oh, no.

572
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,400
But first let me tell you.

573
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,600
If you should lead her into
a fool's paradise, as they say,

574
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,200
it were a very gross kind of behavior,
as they say,

575
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,600
for the gentlewoman is young,

576
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,400
and, therefore,
if you should deal double with her...

577
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,000
I protest. I protest.

578
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,400
Good heart and faith,
I will tell her as much.

579
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,800
Lord, lord, she will be a joyful woman.

580
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,200
What wilt thou tell her, nurse?

581
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,800
I will tell her, sir, that you do protest

582
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,800
which, as I take it,
is a gentleman-like offer.

583
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:55,200
Bid her devise some means
to come to shrift this afternoon.
