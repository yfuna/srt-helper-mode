1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,400
There she shall at Friar Laurence's cell
be shrived and married.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,000
- Here. Here is for thy pains.
- No, truly, sir, not a penny.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,200
Go to, I say you shall.

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,800
This afternoon, sir, she shall be there.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,600
- Commend me to thy lady.
- Ay, a thousand times.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,400
- Peter!
- Anon.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,400
Take my fan and go before.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,400
And apace, apace.

9
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,800
The clock struck 9:00
when I did send the nurse.

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,200
In half an hour she promised to return.

11
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,600
Perchance she cannot meet him.
That's not so.

12
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,600
She is lame.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,200
Love's heralds should be thoughts,

14
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,400
which ten times faster glide
than the sun's beams.

15
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,800
From 9:00 till 12:00 is three long hours.

16
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,200
And yet she is not come.

17
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,600
Had she affections
and warm youthful blood,

18
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,600
she'd be as swift in motion as a ball.

19
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,800
My words would bandy her
to my sweet love, and his to me.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,600
O God, she comes.

21
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,600
O honey nurse, what news?
Hast thou met with him?

22
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,600
- Send thy man away.
- Peter, stay at the gate.

23
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,600
- Anon.
- Now, good, sweet nurse.

24
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,800
- O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
- I am aweary, give me leave a while.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Fie, how my bones ache.
What a jaunt have I had.

26
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,800
I would thou hadst my bones
and I thy news.

27
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,600
Nay, come, I pray thee, speak.
Good, good nurse, speak.

28
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,600
Jesu. What haste?

29
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,600
Can you not stay awhile?

30
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,000
Do you not see that I am out of breath?

31
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,400
How are thou out of breath,

32
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,400
when thou hast breath to say to me
that thou art out of breath?

33
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,400
Is thy news good or bad?

34
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,800
Answer to that.
Let me be satisfied, is it good or bad?

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,600
Well, you have made a simple choice.

36
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,000
You know not how to choose a man.

37
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,000
Go thy ways, wench, serve God.

38
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,800
- What, have you dined at home?
- No, no.

39
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,800
What says he of our marriage?
What of that?

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,800
Lord, how my head aches.
What a head have I!

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,800
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,200
Oh, my back.

43
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,000
The other side.

44
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,400
Beshrew your heart
for sending me about to catch my death

45
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,600
with jaunting up and down.

46
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,200
In faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.

47
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,400
O sweet, sweet, sweet nurse,
tell me, what says my love?

48
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,200
Your love says,

49
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,600
like an honest gentleman and
a courteous and a kind and a handsome

50
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,600
and I warrant, a virtuous...
Where is your mother?

51
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,400
Where is my mother?

52
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,800
Why, she is within. Where should she be?

53
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,800
How oddly thou repliest!

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,400
"Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
where is your mother?"

55
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Oh, God's lady dear! Are you so hot?

56
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,400
Marry, come up, I trow.
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?

57
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,000
Henceforward, do your messages yourself!

58
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,800
Come, what says Romeo?

59
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,800
- Have you got leave to go to shrift today?
- I have.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,600
Then hie you hence
to Friar Laurence's cell,

61
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,000
there stays a husband to make you a wife.

62
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,000
Now comes the wanton blood
up in your cheeks.

63
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,200
They'll be scarlet straight at any news.

64
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,600
Hie you to church, go. I'll to dinner.

65
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,000
Hie you to the cell!

66
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,000
Hie to high fortune.
Honest nurse, farewell.

67
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,000
- Good den, Father.
- Benedicite.

68
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,000
God mark thee to His grace, young son.
I love thy company.

69
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,000
- Where hast thou been?
- I have been feasting with mine enemy,

70
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,800
where on a sudden one hath wounded me
that's by me wounded.

71
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,800
Both our remedies within thy help
and holy physic lies.

72
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,400
Be plain, good son.

73
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,200
Then plainly know, my heart's dear love
is set on the fair daughter of rich Capulet.

74
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,000
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,600
and this I pray that thou consent
to marry us this day.

76
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,400
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here.

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,600
Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
so soon forsaken?

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,800
I pray thee, chide me not.

79
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,000
Amen. Amen.

80
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,400
So smile the heavens upon this holy act,

81
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,800
that after hours with sorrow chide us not.

82
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,200
But come what sorrow can,

83
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,800
it cannot countervail the exchange of joy

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,600
that one short minute gives me
in her sight.

85
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,600
These violent delights have violent ends

86
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,400
and in their triumph die,

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
like fire and powder,
which as they kiss, consume.

88
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,600
Do thou but close our hands
with holy words,

89
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,200
then love-devouring death do what it dare.

90
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,800
It is enough I may but call her mine.

91
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,000
And this alliance may so happy prove,

92
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,800
to turn your household's rancor
to pure love.

93
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,200
Here comes the lady.

94
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,800
Oh, so light a foot will ne'er wear out
the everlasting flint.

95
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,800
Juliet.

96
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,600
Good even to my ghostly confessor.

97
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Romeo shall thank thee,
daughter, for us both.

98
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,400
Ah, Juliet.

99
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,600
If the measure of thy joy
be heaped like mine,

100
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,200
and that thy skill be more to blazon it,

101
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,400
then sweeten with thy breath
this neighbor air,

102
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,000
and let rich music's tongue unfold

103
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
the imagined happiness
that both receive in either

104
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,400
by this dear encounter.

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,800
My true love is grown to such excess,

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,200
I cannot sum up half my wealth.

107
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,800
Come, come with me,
and we will make short work.

108
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
For by your leaves,
you shall not stay alone

109
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,600
till holy church incorporate two in one.

110
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.

111
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,800
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad.

112
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,400
And if we meet,
we shall not escape a brawl.

113
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,000
Thou are like one of those fellows that,
when he enters the confines of a tavern,

114
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,200
claps me a sword upon the table and says,

115
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,600
"God send me no need of thee."

116
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,600
Am I like such a fellow?

117
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,200
Come, come, thou are as hot a Jack
in thy mood as any man in Italy.

118
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,800
If there were two such, we'd have none
shortly, for one would kill the other.

119
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,800
Thou. Thou wilt quarrel with a man
who hath a hair more

120
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,800
or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.

121
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,400
Thou wilt quarrel with a man
for cracking nuts,

122
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,000
having no other reason
than because thou hast hazel eyes.

123
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,800
Thou hast quarreled with a man
for coughing in the street

124
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,000
because he has awakened thy dog
that has lain asleep in the sun.

125
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,800
And yet you will tutor me from quarreling.

126
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,400
And I were so apt to quarrel as thou art.

127
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,600
- By my head, here come the Capulets.
- By my heel, I care not.

128
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,800
Follow me close,
for I will speak with them.

129
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,400
Gentlemen, good den.
A word with one of you.

130
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,200
And but one word with one of us?

131
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,800
Couple it with something.
Make it a word and a blow.

132
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,400
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir,
and you will give me occasion.

133
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,200
Could you not take some occasion
without giving?

134
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,400
- Mercutio, thou consorts with Romeo.
- Consort!

135
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,800
What dost thou make us, minstrels?

136
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,400
An thou make minstrels of us,
look to hear nothing but discords.

137
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,200
Here's my fiddlestick.
Here's that'll make you dance.

138
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,600
Zounds, consort.

139
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,000
Well, peace be with you, sir.
Here comes my man.

140
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,400
Romeo!

141
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,400
The love I bear thee
can afford no better term than this.

142
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,000
Thou art a villain.

143
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,600
Tybalt,

144
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,400
the reason that I have to love thee
doth much excuse the appertaining rage

145
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,000
to such a greeting.

146
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,800
Villain am I none,

147
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,600
therefore farewell.
I see thou know'st me not.

148
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,000
Boy, this shall not excuse
the injuries thou hast done me.

149
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,200
Therefore, turn and draw.

150
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,200
I do protest, I never injured thee,

151
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,200
but love thee
better than thou canst devise,

152
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,400
till thou shall know the reason of my love.

153
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,400
And so, good Capulet, which name
I tender as dearly as mine own,

154
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,200
be satisfied.

155
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,800
Mercutio.

156
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,200
O calm, dishonorable, vile submission.

157
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,800
Alla stoccata carries it away.

158
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,400
Tybalt!

159
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,800
- You rat catcher. Will you walk?
- What wouldst thou have with me?

160
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,200
Good king of cats,
nothing but one of your nine lives.

161
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,800
- I am for you.
- Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.

162
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,600
Come, sir, your passado.

163
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,200
Draw, Benvolio. Beat down their weapons.

164
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,600
Gentlemen, for shame,
forbear this outrage.

165
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,200
Well, I'm hurt.

166
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,400
A plague on both your houses.

167
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,400
I am sped.

168
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,800
- What, is he gone and hath nothing?
- What, art thou hurt?

169
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,600
Ay, a scratch, a scratch.

170
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,200
Marry, 'tis enough. Where is my page?

171
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,400
Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.

172
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.

173
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,800
No, 'tis not so deep as a well,
nor so wide as a church door,

174
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,400
but 'tis enough. It will serve.

175
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,000
Ask for me tomorrow

176
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,800
and you shall find me a grave man.

177
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,400
I'm peppered, I warrant, for this world.

178
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,200
Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse,
a cat to scratch a man to death.

179
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,200
A braggart, a rogue, a villain
that fights by the book of arithmetic.

180
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,400
Why the devil came you between us?

181
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,200
- I was hurt under your arm.
- I thought all for the best.

182
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,400
Help me into some house, Benvolio,
or I shall faint.

183
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,000
A plague on both your houses.

184
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,200
They've made worms' meat of me.

185
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,800
I have it and soundly, too.

186
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,600
Your houses.

187
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,600
Your...

188
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,600
Brave Mercutio's dead.

189
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,400
Ah, sweet Juliet.

190
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,200
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate.

191
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,600
And in my temper softened valor's steel.

192
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,800
Tybalt!

193
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,800
Now, Tybalt,

194
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,000
take the villain back again
that late thou gavest me.

195
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,600
For Mercutio's soul
is but a little way above our heads,

196
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,000
waiting for thine to keep him company.

197
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,800
Either thou or I or both must go with him.

198
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,800
This shall determine that!

199
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,200
Romeo, away! Be gone!

200
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,400
Stand not amazed.

201
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,200
The prince will doom thee death
if thou are taken!

202
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,000
Hence, be gone! Away!

203
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,400
I am fortune's fool.

204
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,800
Why dost thou stay?

205
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,200
Benvolio!

206
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Who began this bloody fray?

207
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,400
O noble prince, an envious thrust
from Tybalt hit the life of stout Mercutio,

208
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,400
then Tybalt fled,
but by and by comes Romeo,

209
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,200
and to it they go like lightning.

210
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,000
Ere I could draw to part them,
was stout Tybalt slain,

211
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,400
and, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.

212
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,800
And for that offense,
immediately do we exile him hence.

213
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,800
I will be deaf to pleadings and excuses,
therefore use none.

214
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,800
But Romeo hence in haste,
else when he's found that hour is his last.

215
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,600
Romeo, come forth.

216
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,400
Father, what news?

217
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,800
What...

218
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,600
What is the Prince's doom?

219
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,000
Hence from Verona art thou banished.

220
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Be patient,
for the world is broad and wide.

221
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,600
There is no world without Verona walls,

222
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,400
but purgatory, torture, hell itself.

223
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,400
- This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
- 'Tis torture and not mercy.

224
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,800
Heaven is here, where Juliet lives.

225
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,800
And every cat and dog and little mouse,
every unworthy thing,

226
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,200
live here in heaven and may look on her,

227
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,800
but Romeo may not.

228
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,200
Hadst thou no poison mixed,

229
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,600
no sharp-ground knife, no sudden mean
of death, though ne'er so mean,

230
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,800
but banished to kill me?

231
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,000
How hast thou the heart,

232
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,800
being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
a sin absolver and my friend professed,

233
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,400
to mangle me with that word "banished"?

234
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,600
Thou fond madman,
hear me but speak a word.

235
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,400
Thou canst not speak of that
thou dost not feel!

236
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,400
Wert thou as young as I,
Juliet thy love, an hour but married,

237
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,000
Tybalt murdered, doting like me,
and, like me, banished,

238
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,000
then might'st thou speak.

239
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,200
So tedious is this day

240
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,600
as is the night before some festival
to an impatient child

241
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,000
that hath new robes
and may not wear them.

242
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,400
Spread thy close curtain,

243
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,600
love-performing night,

244
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,800
that runaway's eyes may wink,

245
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,600
and Romeo leap to these arms,
untalked of and unseen.

246
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,600
Come, gentle night.
Come, loving, black-browed night.

247
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,800
Give me my Romeo.

248
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,200
And, when he shall die,

249
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,800
take him and cut him out in little stars.

250
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,400
And he will make the face of heaven
so fine

251
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,800
that all the world will be in love with night

252
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,200
and pay no worship to the garish sun.

253
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,400
Oh, I have bought the mansion of a love,

254
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,800
but not possessed it.

255
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:26,200
Now, nurse, what news? What news?

256
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,800
Why dost thou wring thy hands?

257
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,000
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead.

258
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,200
We are undone, lady, we are undone.

259
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,600
Tybalt is dead and Romeo banished.

260
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,400
Romeo that killed him, he is banished.

261
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
O God, did Romeo's hand
shed Tybalt's blood?

262
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,600
It did, it did. Alas the day. It did.

263
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,000
O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face.

264
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,200
Beautiful tyrant.

265
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,400
Fiend angelical.

266
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,200
Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st.

267
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,400
A damned saint, an honorable villain!

268
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,800
There's no trust, no faith,
no honesty in men.

269
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,800
Shame come to Romeo.

270
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,800
Blistered be thy tongue for such a wish.

271
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
He was not born to shame.

272
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,400
Oh, and what a beast was I
to chide at him.

273
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,400
Will you speak well of him
that killed your cousin?

274
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,600
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?

275
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,400
Ah, poor my lord,

276
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,800
what tongue shall smooth thy name

277
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,600
when I, thy three hours wife,
have mangled it?

278
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,600
My husband lives,
that Tybalt would have slain.

279
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,800
And Tybalt's dead,
that would have slain my husband.

280
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,400
All this is comfort. Wherefore weep I then?

281
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,600
Tybalt is dead and Romeo banished.

282
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,400
That "banished,"

283
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,200
that one word "banished"
hath slain ten thousand Tybalts!

284
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,400
"Romeo is banished! "

285
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,200
Oh, to speak that word is father, mother,
Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,

286
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,600
all slain, all dead.

287
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,000
I'll find Romeo to comfort you.

288
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,800
I wot well where he is. Hark ye,

289
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,200
your Romeo will be here at night.

290
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,200
He's hid in Laurence's cell.

291
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,200
Oh, find him.

292
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,400
Give this ring to my true knight

293
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,200
and bid him come to take his last farewell.

294
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
- Whence come you? What's your will?
- I come from Lady Juliet.

295
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,200
Welcome, then.

296
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,000
Nurse.

297
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,000
Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?

298
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,200
Oh, she says nothing, sir,
but weeps and weeps.

299
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,200
And now falls on her bed.
And then starts up and Tybalt calls,

300
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,000
and then on Romeo cries.

301
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
As if that name, shot from the deadly level
of a gun, did murder her.

302
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,400
As that name's cursed hand
murdered her kinsman.

303
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,600
Oh, tell me, Friar.

304
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,600
Tell me, in what vile part of this anatomy
doth my name lodge?

305
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,400
Tell me, that I may sack
the hateful mansion.

306
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,400
Hold thy desperate hand. Art thou a man?

307
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,200
Thy wild acts denote
the unreasonable fury of a beast.

308
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,800
Hast thou slain Tybalt?
Wilt thou slay thyself?

309
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,400
And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,

310
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,200
by doing damned hate upon thyself?

311
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,600
Rouse thee, man.

312
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,600
Thy Juliet is alive.

313
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,200
Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,

314
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,400
ascend her chamber,
hence and comfort her.

315
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,200
But look thou stay not
till the watch be set,

316
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,600
for then thou canst not pass to Mantua.

317
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,600
There thou shalt live till we can find
a time to blaze your marriage,

318
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,200
reconcile your friends, beg pardon
of the Prince, and call thee back

319
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:33,400
with twenty hundred thousand times more
joy than thou went'st forth in lamentation.

320
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.

321
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,200
It was the nightingale and not the lark
that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear.

322
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,400
Nightly she sings
on yon pomegranate tree.

323
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,400
And believe me, love,
it was the nightingale.

324
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,600
It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
no nightingale.

325
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,600
Look.

326
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,200
Look.

327
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,400
What envious streaks do lace
the severing clouds in yonder east.

328
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,200
Night's candles are burned out,

329
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,400
and jocund day stands tiptoe
on the misty mountain tops.

330
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,800
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.

331
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,600
Yon light is not daylight, I know it, I.

332
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
It is some meteor that the sun exhales

333
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,400
to be to thee this night a torchbearer,
and light thee on thy way to Mantua.

334
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,800
Therefore stay yet,
thou need'st not to be gone.

335
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,600
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.

336
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,800
I'll say yon gray is not the morning's eye.

337
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Nor that is not the lark,
whose notes do beat the vaulty heaven

338
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,800
so high above our heads.

339
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,800
I have more care to stay than will to go.

340
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,000
Come, death, and welcome.

341
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,800
How is it, my soul?

342
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,400
Let's talk, it is not day.

343
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,600
It is, it is.

344
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Hie hence, be gone, away.

345
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,400
It is the lark that sings so out of tune.

346
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,000
Oh, now be gone.
More light and light it grows.

347
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,800
Nurse.

348
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,400
Your lady mother is coming
to your chamber.

349
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,000
Day is broke. Be wary, look about.

350
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,400
Then, window, let day in,

351
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,400
and let life out.

352
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,800
Farewell.

353
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,400
Farewell.

354
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,800
Art thou gone so?

355
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,800
My lord, my love, my friend.

356
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,200
Oh, think'st thou
we shall ever meet again?

357
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,600
I doubt it not.

358
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,000
And all these woes
shall serve for sweet discourses

359
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,200
in our time to come.

360
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,600
O God.

361
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,200
I have an ill-divining soul.

362
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,400
Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,

363
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,800
as one dead in the bottom of a tomb.

364
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,000
Dry sorrow drinks our blood.

365
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,600
Adieu.

366
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,800
Adieu.

367
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,600
Why, how now, Juliet?

368
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,600
Evermore weeping
for your cousin's death?

369
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,400
What, wilt thou wash him
from his grave with tears?

370
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,000
And if thou couldst,
thou couldst not make him live.

371
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,200
Therefore, have done.

372
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,800
But now

373
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,000
I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.

374
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,200
And joy comes well in such a needy time.

375
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,200
What are they, I beseech your ladyship?

376
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,200
My child, early tomorrow morn

377
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,000
the gallant, young and noble gentleman,

378
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,400
the County Paris, at St. Peter's church,

379
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,600
shall happily make thee there
a joyful bride.

380
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,000
No!

381
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,800
By St. Peter's Church and Peter, too,

382
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,400
he shall not make me there a joyful bride!

383
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,000
I wonder at this haste. That I must wed

384
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,000
ere he that should be husband
comes to woo.

385
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,200
I pray you, tell my lord and father,
madam, I will not marry yet.

386
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,400
Here comes your father.
Tell him so yourself,

387
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,600
and see how he will take it at your hands.

388
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,000
How now, wife?
Have you deliver'd to her our decree?

389
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,800
Ay, sir, but she will none,
she gives you thanks.

390
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,200
Is she not proud?

391
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,400
Doth she not count her blessed,
unworthy as she is,

392
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,200
that we have wrought so worthy
a gentleman to be her bridegroom?

393
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,400
Proud can I never be of what I hate.

394
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,000
Proud me no prouds,

395
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,800
but go with Paris to St. Peter's church,

396
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,600
or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.

397
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,800
Good father, I beseech you on my knees,

398
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,800
hear me with patience
but to speak a word.

399
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,800
Hang thee, young baggage.
Disobedient wretch!

400
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,400
I tell thee what, get thee to church,
or never after look me in the face.

401
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,600
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me.

402
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,400
God in heaven, bless her.
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.

403
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,800
Peace, you mumbling fool.
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl.

404
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,800
- For here we need it not.
- You are too hot!

405
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,600
God's bread! It makes me mad
to have a wretched puling fool

406
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:55,200
to answer, "I'll not wed. I cannot love.
I am too young. I pray you, pardon me."

407
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,200
Look to it, think on it.

408
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,200
I do not use to jest.

409
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,000
If you be mine, I'll give you to my friend.

410
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,800
If you be not, hang, beg,

411
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,800
starve, die in the street.

412
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,600
For, by my soul,
I'll ne'er acknowledge thee.

413
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:22,200
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds
that sees into the bottom of my grief?

414
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,600
Sweet my mother, cast me not away.

415
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,000
Delay this marriage for a month, a week.

416
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,800
Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.

417
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,600
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee!

418
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,400
O God!

419
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,800
O nurse.

420
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,200
How shall this be prevented?

421
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,000
What say'st thou?
Hast thou not a word of joy?

422
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,800
Some comfort, nurse.

423
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,200
Faith.

424
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,400
Faith, here it is.

425
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,000
Romeo is banished.

426
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,200
And all the world to nothing that he dares
ne'er come back to challenge you.

427
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,200
I think it best
you married with the county.

428
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,200
Oh, he's a lovely gentleman.

429
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,400
Romeo is a dish-clout to him.

430
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,600
Beshrew my very heart,

431
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,400
I think you are happy
in this second match,

432
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,200
for it excels your first.

433
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,600
Speak'st thou from thy heart?

434
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,400
Ay, and from my soul, too,
or else beshrew them both.

435
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,400
- Amen.
- What?

436
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,400
Thou hast comforted me marvelous much.

437
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,200
Go in and tell my lady I am gone,

438
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,200
having displeased my father,
to Laurence's cell,

439
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,200
to make confession and to be absolved.

440
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,800
Marry, I will. And this is wisely done.

441
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,400
Ancient damnation!

442
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,600
O most wicked fiend!

443
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,200
Go, counselor.

444
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,400
Thou and my bosom
henceforth shall be twain.

445
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,800
I'll to the friar, to know his remedy.

446
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,800
If all else fail, myself have power to die.

447
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,800
Sir Paris, the time is very short.

448
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,200
My father Capulet will have it so.

449
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,800
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.

450
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,400
You say you do not know the lady's mind.

451
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,400
Uneven is the course, I like it not.

452
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,000
Immoderately she weeps
for Tybalt's death.

453
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,600
Her father counts it dangerous that
she doth give her sorrow so much sway,

454
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,800
and in his wisdom hastes our marriage.

455
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,400
Now do you know the reason of this haste.

456
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,400
Happily met, my lady and my wife.

457
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,800
Come you to make confession
to this father?

458
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Do not deny to him that you love me.

459
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,800
I will confess to you that I love him.

460
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,800
So will you, I am sure, that you love me.

461
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,400
If I do so, it will be of more price,

462
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,400
being spoke behind your back,
than to your face.

463
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,200
Are you at leisure, holy father, now?

464
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,200
My lord, we must entreat the time alone.

465
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,800
God shield, I should disturb devotion.

466
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,800
Juliet, tomorrow early will I rouse you.

467
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,400
Till then, adieu.

468
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,200
And keep this holy kiss.

469
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,400
Oh, shut the door.

470
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,200
Come weep with me.

471
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,600
Past hope, past cure, past help.

472
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,400
Now, Juliet, I already know thy grief.

473
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,200
Tell me not, Friar, that thou hear'st of this,

474
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,200
unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.

475
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,000
God joined my heart and Romeo's,

476
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,800
thou our hands.

477
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,400
And ere this hand,
by thee to Romeo's sealed,

478
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,000
shall be the label to another deed,

479
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,800
or my true heart with treacherous revolt
turn to another,

480
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,800
this shall slay them both.

481
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,400
Hold, daughter.

482
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,800
I do spy a kind of hope.

483
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,200
lf, rather than to marry County Paris,

484
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,200
thou hast the strength of will
to slay thyself,

485
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,200
then is it likely
thou wilt undertake a thing like death?

486
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,600
And I will do it without fear or doubt,

487
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,200
to live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.

488
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,200
Hold, then. Go home,

489
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,400
be merry, give consent to marry Paris.

490
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,600
Tonight look that thou lie alone.

491
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,800
Let not thy nurse lie with thee
in thy chamber.

492
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,800
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,

493
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,000
and this distilled liquor drink thou off.

494
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,200
When presently through all thy veins

495
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,200
shall run a cold and drowsy humor,

496
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,200
for no pulse, no warmth, no breath,

497
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,200
shall testify thou livest.

498
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,600
And in this borrow'd likeness
of shrunk death

499
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours.

500
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,400
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning
comes to rouse thee from thy bed,

501
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,000
there art thou dead.

502
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,600
Then, as the manner of our country is,
in thy best robes uncover'd on the bier,

503
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,600
thou shalt be borne
to that same ancient vault

504
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,200
where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.

505
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,800
In the mean time,
shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,

506
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,400
and hither shall he come.
And he and I will watch thy waking,

507
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,200
and that very night
shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.

508
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,400
Oh, give me, give me. Tell me not of fear.

509
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,200
Hold. Get you gone.

510
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,000
Be strong and prosperous in this resolve.

511
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,000
I'll send a friar with speed to Mantua
with my letters to thy lord.

512
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,000
Love give me strength.

513
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Farewell, dear father.

514
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,400
Hence to Mantua.

515
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,200
Early in the morning, see thou deliver it.

516
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,200
Holy Reverend Friar, come, come with me.

517
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,200
- The infectious pestilence.
- Pestilence.

518
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,400
Pestilence.

519
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,400
- Pestilence!
- Pestilence!

520
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,200
Take heed! Take heed! Hold me not!

521
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,600
Take heed!

522
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,200
Ay, those attires are best,

523
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,600
but, gentle nurse, I pray thee,

524
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,400
leave me to myself tonight.

525
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,400
Need you my help?

526
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,600
No, madam.

527
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,000
So please you, let me now be left alone,

528
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,600
and let the nurse this night,
sit up with you,

529
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,600
for I am sure you have your hands full
all in this so sudden business.

530
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,400
Good night. Get thee to bed and rest,
for thou hast need.

531
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,400
Farewell.

532
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,400
God knows when we shall meet again.

533
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,600
I have a faint cold fear
thrill through my veins,

534
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,800
that almost freezes up the heat of life.

535
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,600
I'll call them back, to comfort me. Nurse!

536
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,600
What should she do here?

537
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,000
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.

538
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,400
What if this mixture do not work at all?

539
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,400
Shall I be married then
tomorrow morning?

540
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,800
No, no.

541
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,000
This shall forbid it.

542
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,800
Lie thou there.

543
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,600
What if it be a poison,

544
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,200
which the friar subtly hath minister'd
to have me dead

545
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,000
lest in this marriage
he should be dishonor'd

546
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,400
because he married me before to Romeo?

547
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,800
I fear it is,

548
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,200
and yet, methinks, it should not,
for he hath still been tried a holy man.

549
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,600
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,

550
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:15,600
I wake before the time
that Romeo come to redeem me?

551
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,600
There is a fearful point.

552
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,600
Shall I not then be stifled in the vault

553
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,200
to whose foul mouth
no healthsome air breathes in?

554
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,400
Or, if I live,

555
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:37,400
is it not very like the horrible conceit
of death and night

556
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,600
together with the terror of the place

557
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,200
where, for these many hundred years,

558
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,200
the bones of all my buried ancestors
are pack'd,

559
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:54,000
where bloody Tybalt, yet but green
in earth, lies festering in his shroud,

560
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,600
where as they say
at some hours in the night spirits resort.

561
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,200
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
so early waking

562
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,800
what with loathsome smells and shrieks
like mandrakes torn out of the earth,

563
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,400
that living mortals, hearing them,
run mad.

564
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,600
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,

565
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,200
environed with all these hideous fears,

566
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,400
and madly play with my forefathers' joints

567
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,400
and pluck the mangled Tybalt
from his shroud?

568
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:28,200
And in this rage with some
great kinsman's bone, as with a club,

569
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,800
dash out my desperate brains?

570
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
O, look.

571
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,800
Methinks I see my cousin's ghost

572
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,600
seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
upon a rapier's point.

573
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,600
Stay, Tybalt, stay.

574
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,800
Romeo, I come.

575
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,800
This do I drink to thee.

576
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,000
Hold.

577
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,400
Take these keys
and fetch more spices, nurse.

578
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,600
They call for dates and quinces
in the pastry.

579
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,000
Nurse! Wife!

580
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:15,400
What ho! What, nurse, I say.
Go waken Juliet!

581
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,400
Hie, make haste, make haste.

582
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,800
The bridegroom, he is come already.

583
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,400
Mistress! What, Mistress!

584
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,400
Juliet.

585
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,200
Fast, I warrant her, she.

586
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,000
Why, lamb.

587
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,800
Why, lady.

588
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,200
Fie, you slug-a-bed.

589
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,200
What, not a word?

590
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,600
Marry and amen, how sound she is asleep.

591
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,200
I needs must wake her.

592
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,800
Madam,

593
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,800
madam,

594
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,200
madam.

595
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,800
My lord!

596
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,400
My lady!

597
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,000
What noise is here?

598
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,400
What is the matter?

599
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,400
O me.

600
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,200
My child, my only life.

601
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,800
Help, help!

602
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,200
Help!

603
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,800
For shame, bring Juliet forth.
Her lord is come!

604
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,800
Alack the day.

605
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,000
She's dead.

606
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,800
She's dead.

607
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,800
She's dead.

608
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,200
Let me see her.

609
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,400
Death lies on her

610
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:01,200
like an untimely frost
upon the sweetest flower of all the field.

611
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,200
Hence, in haste. Farewell.

612
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,000
Help! Call help!

613
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:43,400
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,

614
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:49,000
my dreams presage
some joyful news at hand.

615
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,600
I dreamt my lady came
and found me dead.

616
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,400
Strange dream that gives a dead man
leave to think.

617
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,400
And breathed such life
with kisses in my lips

618
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,200
that I revived

619
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,800
and was an emperor.

620
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,400
Ah, me.

621
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,000
How sweet is love itself possessed.

622
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,400
When but love's shadows
are so rich in joy.

623
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,000
News from Verona.

624
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,400
How now, Balthasar?

625
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,800
Dost thou not bring me letters
from the friar?

626
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,000
How doth my lady? Is my father well?

627
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
How fares my Juliet?

628
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:50,600
That I ask again, for nothing can be ill
if she be well.

629
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,200
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.

630
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,600
Her body sleeps in Capels' monument,

631
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,000
and her immortal part with angels lives.

632
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,400
Oh, pardon me for bringing these ill news.

633
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,800
Is it even so?

634
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,600
Then I defy you, stars.

635
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,600
Hire me post-horses. I will hence tonight.

636
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,600
I do beseech you, sir, have patience.

637
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,800
Your looks are pale and wild
and do import some misadventure.

638
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,400
Thou art deceived.

639
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,000
Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.

640
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:49,000
- Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
- No, my good lord.

641
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,600
No matter.

642
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:57,800
Get thee gone, hire those horses.
I'll be with thee straight.

643
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,800
Well, Juliet,

644
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,600
I will lie with thee tonight.

645
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,000
Apothecary.

646
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,600
Come hither, man.

647
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,800
I see that thou art poor.

648
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,000
Here is 40 ducats.

649
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,200
Let me have a dram of poison,

650
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,800
such soon-speeding gear as will disperse
itself through all the veins

651
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,000
that the life-weary taker may fall dead.

652
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,000
Such mortal drugs I have,

653
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,800
but Mantua's law is death
to any he that utters them.

654
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,200
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
and fear'st to die?

655
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,000
The world is not thy friend
nor the world's law.

656
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,400
The world affords no law
to make thee rich.

657
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,200
Then be not poor, but break it. Take this.

658
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:16,000
My poverty but not my will consent.

659
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,600
I pay thy poverty and not thy will.

660
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:32,000
Put this in any liquid thing you will
and drink it off.

661
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,200
And if you had the strength of 20 men,

662
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,400
it would dispatch you straight.

663
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,600
Here is thy gold,

664
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,400
worse poison to men's souls,

665
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,400
doing more murder
in this loathsome world

666
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:48,200
than these poor compounds
that thou may'st not sell.

667
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,600
I sell thee poison,

668
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
thou hast sold me none.

669
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,600
Who bare my letter then to Romeo?

670
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:21,200
I could not send it,
nor get a messenger to bring it thee,

671
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,600
so fearful were they of infection.

672
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,600
Unhappy fortune.

673
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,600
By my brotherhood, that letter,
the neglecting of it may do much danger.

674
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,200
Now must I to the monument alone.

675
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,400
Within this three hours
will fair Juliet wake.

676
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,400
She will beshrew me much that Romeo
hath had no notice of these accidents.

677
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:48,800
Sweet flower,
with flowers thy bridal bed I strew.

678
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,800
O woe, thy canopy is dust and stone.

679
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,400
Give me the light.

680
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:03,200
Upon thy life I charge thee,
whate'er thou hear'st or see'st,

681
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,800
stand all aloof,
and do not interrupt me in my course.

682
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,600
I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.

683
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:12,400
So shalt thou show me friendship.
Take thou that.

684
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Live and be prosperous.

685
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,200
And farewell, good fellow.

686
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:45,200
Thou detestable maw,
thou womb of death,

687
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,400
gorged with the dearest morsel
of the earth.

688
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:54,200
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,

689
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,400
and, in despite,
I'll cram thee with more food.

690
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,200
Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!

691
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,400
Can vengeance be pursued
further than death?

692
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,600
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee!

693
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,800
Obey and go with me, for thou must die!

694
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,600
I must, indeed,
and therefore came I hither.

695
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:17,600
I beseech thee, youth, put not another sin
upon my head by urging me to fury.

696
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,600
Stay not, be gone. Live!

697
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:23,200
And hereafter say a madman's mercy
bade thee run away.

698
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:27,000
I do defy thy conjurations
and apprehend thee for a villain here!

699
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,000
Give me thy hand,

700
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:24,600
one writ with me
in sour misfortune's book.

701
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:28,400
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.

702
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:30,800
A grave?

703
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:35,800
Oh, no, a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
for here lies Juliet,

704
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,600
and her beauty makes this vault
a feasting presence full of light.

705
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,600
Death, lie thou there,

706
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,000
by a dead man interred.

707
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Oh, my love, my wife.

708
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,400
Death that hath suck'd the honey
of thy breath

709
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,000
hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.

710
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,800
Thou art not conquered.

711
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:48,200
Beauty's ensign yet
is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,

712
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:52,600
and death's pale flag
is not advanced there.

713
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,800
Ah, dear Juliet, I still will stay with thee

714
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,800
and never from this palace of dim night
depart again.

715
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,000
Here will I set up my everlasting rest

716
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:10,600
and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars

717
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,400
from this world-wearied flesh.

718
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Eyes, look your last.

719
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,800
Arms, take your last embrace.

720
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:26,600
And, lips, O you the doors of breath,

721
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:32,800
seal with a righteous kiss
a dateless bargain to engrossing death.

722
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:46,400
Come, bitter conduct,
come, unsavory guide.

723
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:53,200
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
the dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark.

724
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,800
Here's to my love.

725
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,800
Oh, true Apothecary, thy drugs are quick.

726
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,400
Thus with a kiss

727
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,400
I die.

728
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,600
Romeo.

729
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,800
Alack, alack, what blood is this?

730
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,600
What mean these masterless
and gory swords

731
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,400
to lie discolor'd by this place of peace?

732
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,400
Oh, what an unkind hour
is guilty of this lamentable chance?

733
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,200
O comfortable friar,

734
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,800
where is my lord?

735
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:03,000
I do remember well where I should be,

736
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,200
and there I am.

737
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,600
Where is my Romeo?

738
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:14,800
Lady,

739
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,600
come from that nest of death,
contagion, and unnatural sleep.

740
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:22,200
A greater power than we can contradict

741
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:25,400
hath thwarted our intents.
Come, come away.

742
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,000
Thy husband there lies dead.

743
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,800
Stay not to question,
for the watch is coming.

744
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,800
Come, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.

745
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:43,800
Go, get thee hence,

746
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,200
for I will not away.

747
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,400
O churl.

748
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:40,200
Drunk all, and left no friendly drop
to help me after.

749
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,000
I will kiss thy lips. Haply,
some poison yet doth hang on them.

750
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:55,200
Thy lips are warm.

751
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,000
Lead, boy. Which way?

752
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,600
Yea, noise?

753
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,000
Then I'll be brief.

754
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Oh, happy dagger.

755
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,800
This is thy sheath.

756
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,600
There rust,

757
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:27,800
and let me die.

758
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,800
Go tell the Prince.

759
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,400
Run to the Capulets!

760
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,800
Raise up the Montagues.

761
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:21,600
Capulet. Montague.

762
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:25,200
See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,

763
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,800
that heaven finds means
to kill your joys with love.

764
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,600
And I, for winking at your discords, too,
have lost a brace of kinsmen.

765
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,000
All are punished.

766
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:40,000
O brother Montague, give me thy hand.

767
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:46,200
This is my daughter's jointure,
for no more can I demand.

768
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,000
But I can give thee more.

769
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:50,600
For I will raise her statue in pure gold.

770
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,200
That while Verona by that name is known

771
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:55,800
there shall no figure at such rate be set

772
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,200
as that of true and faithful Juliet.

773
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:01,000
As rich shall Romeo by his lady lie,

774
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,600
poor sacrifices of our enmity.

775
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:07,000
A glooming peace this morning
with it brings.

776
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:10,000
The sun for sorrow will not show his head.

777
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:14,800
For never was a story of more woe
than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
